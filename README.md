# HunterVerse
HunterVerse is a game where you can hunt down animals, sell, sacrifice, and battle against others!

### How to download and run the game?
* First, you need to have a Python IDE installed with `tkinter` library to run the game. You can download the IDE [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).<br>
* Before installing `tkinter` GUI library, you need to install `pip` (Python Package Installer). You can read the tutorial to download `pip` [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).<br>
* After that, you can install `tkinter` library by opening up **Command Prompt** on Windows and type in:
```py
pip install tk
```
**Note: You won't need to install Python or anything when the official version is released.**
* After doing all the set up steps, this is how you can open and run the game file.
> 1. After downloading a `.rar` or `.zip` file, unzip it.
> 2. After you unzip the file into a folder, you should see a `main.py` file in that folder.
> 3. Open that `main.py` file. You will see a register window and a terminal.
> 4. Ignore the terminal, just enter your username into the entry field and press the `Register` button.
> 5. Wait for the application to process. It usually takes from 3 to 5 seconds.
> 5. Then, you should see the game starts initializing.
> 6. Wait for the initialization to finish and enjoy the game!
* Also, if you want to run the back-up file (early access to the newest version), you can do like below:
> 1. After downloading a `.rar` or `.zip` file, unzip it.
> 2. After you unzip the file into a folder, you should see a folder named `backup`.
> 3. Open that folder, you will see a single `.py` file named `backup_main.py`.
> 4. Move that file into the main directory (where the `main.py` is located).
> 5. Then, open that `backup_main.py` file. You will see a register window and a terminal.
> 6. Ignore the terminal, just enter your username into the entry field and press the `Register` button.
> 7. Wait for the application to process. It usually takes from 3 to 5 seconds.
> 8. Then, you should see the game starts initializing.
> 9. Wait for the initialization to finish and enjoy the newest version of the game!
